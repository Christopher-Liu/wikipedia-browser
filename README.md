# Wikipedia Browser

Single page web application that allows the user to search for Wikipedia articles based on a search query they can enter into the input form. Additionally,  there is a "randomize" button that will output a random Wikipedia article. Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery (for the AJAX calls). Originally made as my submission for a frontend development project for the freeCodeCamp curriculum.

## Prerequisites
Nothing extra needs to be done/installed from the user, except to enter a search query and submit it. Note that if you are using an adblocker or something else that disables JavaScript on web pages, they might interfere with the AJAX requests.
